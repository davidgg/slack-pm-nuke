Slack PM Nuke

Short Description:
A simple tool to remove your messages from any Slack conversation or channel. Just open the conversation and let the extension do the work.

Detailed Description:
Slack PM Nuke is an unofficial extension that helps you clean up your message history in Slack conversations and channels. With a single click, you can remove all your messages from any Slack conversation.

How It Works:
The extension simulates human interaction to safely remove messages:
• Starts with the most recent messages
• Processes each visible message one by one
• Once current messages are handled, it automatically loads older messages
• Continues this process from newest to oldest messages
• Uses natural delays and interactions to ensure reliable operation

Key Features:
• Simple one-click operation
• Works in both direct messages and channels
• Automatically scrolls through conversation history
• Respects Slack's message deletion permissions
• Built-in rate limiting to prevent API issues
• Natural interaction patterns to ensure reliability

How to Use:
1. Open Slack in your browser
2. Navigate to the conversation or channel where you want to remove your messages
3. Click the extension icon
4. Confirm the deletion process
5. Keep the tab open until the process completes

Important Notes:
• The extension will attempt to delete ALL messages that you have permission to remove
• The process continues until it reaches the beginning of the conversation
• Built-in delays ensure smooth operation with Slack's API
• Due to the nature of the extension, you might need to run it multiple times
• You can navigate to any recent message to start the deletion process from there
• Please note that thread messages are not deleted
• If the process stops before completion, simply run it again
• The extension works with Slack's web interface and may need updates when Slack changes

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This is an unofficial tool and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Slack. The extension may stop working if Slack updates their web interface. Instead of leaving a negative review if something breaks, please contact the developer for support.

Privacy & Permissions:

Support:
