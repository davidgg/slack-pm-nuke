Host Permission Justification (https://*.slack.com/*):

This extension requires access to Slack's web domains to function properly. The host permission is essential because:

1. Message Deletion: The extension needs to interact with Slack's web interface to:
   • Locate user messages in conversations
   • Access message deletion controls
   • Confirm deletion actions
   • Navigate through conversation history

2. Workspace Compatibility: The wildcard permission (*.slack.com) is required because:
   • Slack workspaces use different subdomains
   • Users access Slack through various workspace URLs
   • Each workspace maintains its own URL structure

The permission is used securely:
• Only activates on Slack domains
• Runs only when user initiates deletion
• No data collection or external transmission
• Limited to message deletion functionality

This is the minimum permission needed to provide the core message deletion feature across all Slack workspaces.
