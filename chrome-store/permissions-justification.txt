activeTab Permission Justification:

The activeTab permission is required to interact with the current Slack tab when the user initiates message deletion. This permission:

• Allows access to the current tab only when the extension icon is clicked
• Enables finding and interacting with message elements
• Permits execution of the deletion script on the active Slack page
• Ensures privacy by limiting access to only when needed

The extension uses this minimal permission approach because:
• It's temporary and only active when the user clicks the extension
• It's more privacy-focused than requesting permanent access
• It only works on the currently active tab
• Access is automatically revoked when the tab changes

scripting Permission Justification:

The scripting permission is needed to execute the message deletion functionality on Slack's web interface. This permission:

• Enables injection of the deletion script into Slack pages
• Allows simulation of necessary user interactions (clicks, confirmations)
• Ensures reliable operation across different Slack workspaces
• Maintains proper execution context for message deletion

Security measures:
• Scripts only run on Slack domains
• Code executes only after user confirmation
• No data collection or external communication
• Operations limited to message deletion tasks

Host Permission Justification (https://*.slack.com/*):

This extension requires access to Slack's web domains to function properly. The host permission is essential because:

1. Message Deletion: The extension needs to interact with Slack's web interface to:
   • Locate user messages in conversations
   • Access message deletion controls
   • Confirm deletion actions
   • Navigate through conversation history

2. Workspace Compatibility: The wildcard permission (*.slack.com) is required because:
   • Slack workspaces use different subdomains
   • Users access Slack through various workspace URLs
   • Each workspace maintains its own URL structure

The permission is used securely:
• Only activates on Slack domains
• Runs only when user initiates deletion
• No data collection or external transmission
• Limited to message deletion functionality
